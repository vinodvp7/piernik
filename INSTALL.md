# Quick start with Piernik

For a typical desktop Linux installation you may need to add few packages to be able to compile and run Piernik.

## Ubuntu

For Ubuntu try:

    sudo apt install git make openmpi-bin libhdf5-openmpi-dev libfftw3-dev \
    pkg-config pycodestyle python3-numpy gfortran graphviz parallel gnuplot \
    python-h5py

If the above complains that `E: Unable to locate package mpich` then do:

    sudo add-apt-repository universe

and try again to install the pacages mentioned above. You may use `libhdf5-mpich-dev` and `mpich` if you prefer MPICH over OpenMPI.

## Fedora 32 .. 42 and possibly newer

For Fedora try:

    sudo dnf install git make hdf5-openmpi-devel fftw-devel environment-modules \
    graphviz gnuplot-wx python python3-pycodestyle python3-numpy python3-h5py \
    python3-matplotlib parallel python-h5py gnuplot

You may use `hdf5-mpich-devel` if you prefer MPICH over OpenMPI.

* To enable MPI compiler wrappers in Fedora, use:

        module load mpi

    The above line is worth putting in your `.profile` so you won't have to remember it.

* Old approach to the Fortran MPI interface is now strongly disfavoured and Piernik does not compile by default. Use `-fallow-argument-mismatch` to turn MPI-related errors into warnings.
* The wrapper `h5pfc` from OpenMPI requires to set `-I/usr/lib64/gfortran/modules/openmpi/`.
* A compiler option `-frecursive` is suggested by some compilers to be safer than the default in few places by the MPI wrappers but it breaks the convergence in CRESP iitialization (gfortran 14.x).
* MPICH seems to have random bugs that manifest e.g by crashing at `MPI_Waitall` in `cg_list_bnd::internal_boundaries_MPI_1by1`.
* MPICH uses `-Werror=format-security` compiler flag which is no longer valid for `gfortran`. Use

      sudo sed -i 's/-Werror=format-security //' /usr/lib64/mpich/bin/mpif90

  to fix the warnings

* OpenMPI refuses to run on all threads of a CPU with SMT/HT. Override with `--use-hwthread-cpus` or `--oversubscribe` (only when necessary).
* If the wrapper `h5pfc` complains about "Nonexistent include directory" you may need to edit it (as a sudoer/root) and fix the `includedir` shell variable (seen in Fedora 37 and later).

### older Fedora releases (24 .. 31)

* Install `python-pycodestyle` instead of `python3-pycodestyle` if necessary for `make qa`.
* If you are affected by a bug in dependencies in Fedora packages that results in failure of MPI compilation due to missing `/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/redhat-hardened-cc1`, you can fix it by installing the missing package:

        sudo dnf install redhat-rpm-config

    You can also get rid of these *hardening* and *fortyfying* features (as these are unlikely to be important for a Piernik user and may negatively impact code performance) by stripping them off from the wrappers:

        sudo sed -i 's/-specs=[^ "]*//g' /usr/lib64/mpich/bin/h5pfc \
        /usr/lib64/mpich/bin/mpif90

* If you see warnings saying that `-Werror=format-security` is not valid for Fortran, do:

        sudo sed -i 's/-Werror=format-security//' /usr/lib64/mpich/bin/h5pfc \
        /usr/lib64/mpich/bin/mpif90

    Remember that doing so is a sort of hack, which may take revenge on you in a distant future.

If you have installed OpenMPI libraries, remember to replace `mpich` with `openmpi` in the `sed` calls above.

### Other systems

On other systems you need to find your own way (and you may choose to describe it here). You will need:

* git
* decent Fortran 2008 compiler (for such things as polymorphism or modern MPI interface)
* MPI with Fortran support, preferably version that provides mpi_f08.mod. If it is limited to mpi.mod, it must provide interface to all MPI calls
* hdf5 1.8.8 or newer with high-level library, Fortran 2003 interface and MPI support (--enable-shared --enable-fortran --enable-fortran2003 --enable-parallel) – it allows you to use a wrapper ‘h5pfc’ as a compiler
* Python (unfortunately we still have some 2.7-based scripts), including packages such as h5py, numpy
* There are optional tasks that depend on gnuplot, parallel, graphviz and yt

## Piernik

Now make sure that you've forked Piernik project on GitHub and in a directory of your choice do:

    git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/piernik

Now you can `cd piernik` and test whether everything compiles well by calling:

    ./setup maclaurin

which should finish with a message:

    'maclaurin' ready in 'runs/maclaurin'.

The `./setup` command without any arguments will give you a list of recognized options. You can put some them in `.setuprc` file if you want to use them always.

Also look at the top of `Makefile` to find some useful tricks.

The file `bin/bash_completion.sh` may also make your life with Piernik a little bit easier by allowing to complete some setup options and problem names.

## Continuous Integration in Piernik

To check whether the Piernik code works well with your modifications one can run the included tests. We used to maintain a Jenkins server for it but recently we switched to equivalent implementation in Makefile. To run all the tests, invoke:

    make CI -j

Do it always before you commit to the repository anything that is intended to be merged with the `master` branch. Do not use the `-j` flag on old computers equipped with a quad-core CPU or less.

There are three groups of tests there: `QA`, `artifacts` and `gold`. You can run one group or only particular tests (e.g. when only one test is failing). Do

    make help

to get current list of implemented checks.

# Setting up Intel Fortran compiler

First, you have to obtain the software, as it most likely is not packaged in the regular repositories of your distro. You can obtain the packages [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit-download.html). Next, install `intel-hpckit` (a huge bunch of packages, IIRC ~15 GB) or at least `intel-oneapi-mpi-devel`, `intel-oneapi-compiler-fortran` `intel-oneapi-compiler-dpcpp-cpp-and-cpp-classic` and their dependencies. Make sure that you have working C++ compiler in your system, such as `gcc-c++` even when you don't need C++ interface for HDF5.

Then, you have to set up paths in your environment:

    source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh

which should set up the latest versions of everything.

For Piernik you need also to compile HDF5 as it is not bundled in oneAPI repository. You can find the HDF5 sources [here](https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/source-code/), download them and unpack somewhere. Then configure and compile, eg.:

    ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/intel/HDF5 --enable-fortran --enable-shared \
    --enable-parallel  --with-pic CC=mpiicc FC=mpiifort CXX=mpiicpc \
    CFLAGS="-fPIC -O3 -xHost -ip -fno-alias -align" \
    FFLAGS="-fPIC -O3 -xHost -ip -fno-alias -align" \
    CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -O3 -xHost -ip -fno-alias -align" \
    FFLAGS="-I/opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/include -L/opt/intel/oneapi/mpi/latest/lib"
    make -j
    make install

* Please note that the classic compilers like `icc` will be soon deprecated so some modifications may be needed in order to use new family of compilers (`icx` and others).
* While it may be tempting to install HDF5 system-wide, in `/opt/intel/HDF5`, there are problems arising when you try to do `sudo make install` because some relinking fails as the subshell calls don't know proper paths.

Make sure that your shell knows about the new HDF5 scripts and libraries:

    export PATH=${HOME}/intel/HDF5/bin/:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${HOME}/intel/HDF5/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Last but not least, you have to prepare compiler configuration file. The absolute minimum is:

    PROG     = piernik
    F90      = h5pfc
    F90FLAGS = -r8

Of course there are may other useful options for optimization or checking which you may add. I do not recommend to use `-ipo` as I found some weird Piernik crashes when this option was used.

Let's hope that at this point your Intel compilers are able to produce correct code.
