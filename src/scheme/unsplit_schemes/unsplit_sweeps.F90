!! \brief The job of this module is simple : Pass a  block of cg to solve to do a unsplit update of the state
!! Currently we dont not add AMR support or ppp monitoring. Sister module sweeps is used for directional sweep update and is called by
!! fluid update module. We will call this module from fluid_unsplit_update which is in turn mentioned in fluid_update to keep this line of 
!! additions away from the main code and merger it later. We are not adding fargo support either. This will be the first update after this works
